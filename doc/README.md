## Introduction

**statem** is a JavaScript state/turing machine framework which lets you manage your application's *total state* (i.e. named states, transitions, data, and rewriting of inputs).

::: tip
 StateM is largely based on Erlang OTP’s [gen_statem](http://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/statem.html "gen_statem") behavior.
:::

#### Event Driven

*StateM* is an event-driven state machine where the input is an event that triggers a state transition and the output is actions executed during the state transition. Events drive the state machine and are externally triggered or internally generated by the state machine. Pending events are tracked on a priority queue that preserves entry order. 

#### Handlers

State machines are specified as an ordered list of handlers keyed on `Event x State` tuples (wildcards and patterns are allowed to combine handlers). 

#### Handling Events 

If the state machine is in state `S` and event `E` occurs, the state machine will perform actions `A` and make a transition to state `S'`(`S'` can be equal to `S` and `A` can be empty).
```js
State(S) x Event(E) -> Actions(A), State(S')
```
To do this, statem will match the tuple `ExS` against the keys of the ordered list of handlers for the first matching handler, execute its actions `A` and transition to the   

#### Arbitrary Data
State machines can hold arbitrary data which is provided to, and can be mutated by, it's event handlers. 


#### Total State
*Statem* provides management of *total state*, i.e.:

*   Management of states and transitions as in a DFA,
*   Custom read/write memory available to handlers,
*   Ability to rewrite inputs by postponing them.

## Features

*   **Co-located code**: Event, states, transitions and actions in one place.
*   **Inserted Events**: Insert events from within the specification.
*   **State Entry Events**: Automatically generates Entry events on state change.
*   **Timeouts**: Install timeouts for state transitions, new events, or just plain timeouts.

## Installation

Install with `npm`:

```bash
npm install --save gen-statem
```

## Usage

Create a state machine by calling `StateMachine's` constructor and passing it a list of handlers, the initial state and optional data.

::: tip NOTE
The state machine’s data type `TData` is a type argument (`StateMachine<TData>`).
:::

For example, the state machine below toggles states `ONE` and `TWO` on event `next`. ![](https://documents.lucidchart.com/documents/eef39cb2-9656-4c52-88d8-eb6c9f6a5cec/pages/YGcM5DNywbTK?a=1152&x=85&y=151&w=360&h=181&store=1&accept=image/*&auth=LCA%20a77efaa9c861072b1008c96fd065a7b008f5aa33-ts=1538363749)

```ts
let sm = new StateMachine<void>({
    handlers: [
        ['cast#next#ONE', 'TWO'],
        ['cast#next#TWO', () => nextState('ONE')], ],
    initialState: "ONE", })
sm.startSM()
sm.on('stateChanged', (state, old, data, event) => {
    console.log(`${old} --> ${state} on ${event ? event.toString() : ''}`)
})

sm.cast('next') // ONE --> TWO on Cast@Low { context: 'next' }
sm.cast('next') // TWO --> ONE on Cast@Low { context: 'next' }
```

### Subclassing StateMachine

Extending the `StateMachine` class lets you declare and implement a public API for your state machine (and wrap call/cast dispatch calls).

::: tip
Handler functions are called with `this` set to the state machine instance.
:::

```ts
class PingPong extends StateMachine<void> {
    handlers: Handlers<void> = [
        ['cast#next#ONE', 'TWO'],
        ['cast#next#TWO', 'ONE'], ]
    initialState = "ONE"
    // Define our public API
    next() {
        this.cast('next')
    }
}

let sm = new PingPong()
sm.startSM()
sm.on('stateChanged', (state, old, data, event) => {
    console.log(`${old} --> ${state} on ${event ? event.toString() : ''}`)
})

sm.next() // ONE --> TWO on Cast@Low { context: 'next' }
sm.next() // TWO --> ONE on Cast@Low { context: 'next' }
```

### In the Browser

Fetch it from npm via unpkg:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/gen-statem/dist/umd/gen-statem.js"></script>
```

### React State Management

StateM accepts a `DataProxy` object to synchronize its internal data with external objects such as React components.

> Terminology: State machine data == React component state

```js
class App extends React.Component {

  constructor() {
    this.sm = new StateMachine( {
      dataProxy: {
        get: () => this.state,
        set: ( data, state ) => this.setState( { ...data, currentState: state } ),
      },
    } )
  }
}
```

## How It Works

### Routes

StateM uses the url path to parameterized route matching seen in [express](www.expressjs.com) et. al.

#### Current Event Routes

The current event and current state are mapped to a route string as:

```
<current event>#<event context>#<current state>
```

For example:

| Event | Event Context | Current State | Route |
|-------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| cast  |  `"flip"` | off | `"cast#flip#off"` |
| cast  | `{button: 2}` | locked | `"cast#button/2#off"`|
| call | `"getInfo"` | one | `"call/internalId#getInfo/2#one"` |

#### Event Handler Routes

In addition to string literals, handler routes can include:

*   Parameter capture patterns (`:param`) capture up to the next `/`, `#` or the end of the route.
*   Splats (`*param`) capture from up to `#` or the end of the route.
*   Parts of the route can be marked optional by wrapping in parenthesis. Optional parts can include parameter capture and splats.

##### Examples

*   `cast#flip#:state` will match a `cast(flip)` event in any state and provide the current state as an argument (`args.param`) to the handler.
*   `call/:from#getInfo#:state` will capture the callerId and state as `args.from` and `args.state` respectively.
*   `"cast#button/:digit#locked` will capture a button press in the `locked` state and provide the digit value in `args.digit`.
*   `"cast#*context#open` intercepts any `cast` events in state `open` regardless of the parameters passed when cast was invoked (note: the splat will be available as `args.context`).

### Event Handlers

A key part of a state machine specification is the list of (route, handler) tuples:

```
(string | Array<string>, function | string | [string, string | number])
```

> Note: Event handlers are specified as an array to preserve order (vs. objects, where property[iteration order](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in#Deleted_added_or_modified_properties) is arbitrary).

#### Multiple Routes to a Handler

When a route is specified as an array, it is treated as a boolean OR, i.e. if any route matches an incoming event route, the corresponding handler is invoked.

#### Handler Functions

Handler functions receive the following:

```ts
type HandlerOpts<TData> = {
    args: { [k in string]: string },
    current: State,
    data: TData,
    event: Event,
    route: string
}
```

*   `current`: the state machine’s current state.
*   `data`: the state machine’s current data.
*   `args`: any arguments or splats parsed from the incoming event’s route.
*   `event`: the actual incoming event.
*   `route`: the event’s route.

Handler functions can return:

*   `ResultBuilder` a fluent builder for `Results`.
*   `Result` \- verbose, not recommended.
*   `void` \- interpreted as `keepStateAndData`

#### `string` Handlers

Instead of a handler function, you can provide a

*   `state: string` \- interpreted as a next state directive.
*   `[state: string, timeout: string | number]` \- interpreted as a next state directive and event timeout.

### Result Builder

StateM provides a fluent interface (`ResultBuilder`) for specifying state transitions and actions in handler functions.

The following functions return a `ResultBuilder`:

*   [keepState](#): Instructs the state machine to keep the current state (i.e. transition to the same state). Does not emit a state entry event.
*   [repeatState](#): Like `keepState`, but emits a state entry event.
*   [nextState(state)](#): Instructs the state machine to transition to the given `state` (can be the current state).

#### ResultBuilder Methods

`ResultBuilders` provide the following chainable methods:

*   [data(spec)](#): Instructs the state machine to mutate state data with the given `spec`.
*   [eventTimeout(time)](#): Starts the event timer which may result in a `EventTimeoutEvent` event if a new event is not received.
*   [stateTimeout(time)](#): Starts the state timer which may result in a `StateTimeoutEvent` event if a state transition does not occur.
*   [timeout(time, name)](#): Starts a generic timer with an optional name which may result in a `GenericTimeoutEvent`. Calling `timeout(name)` will cancel the event if it has not yet fired.
*   [nextEvent(type, context, extra)](#): Inserts an event of the given type at the front of the queue so that it is executed before pending events.
*   [internalEvent(context, extra)](#): Like `nextEvent`, this method inserts an `InternalEvent` event.
*   [postpone](#): Instructs the state machine to postpone the current until the state changes at which point any postponed events are delivered before pending events.
*   [reply(from, msg)](#): Instructs the state machine to reply to the sender with id `from`; the result of a prior invocation of `call`.

### Mutating State Machine Data

State machine data is mutated by calling the `data` on `ResultBuilder` with [immutability-helper](#) commands, including:

*   `{$push: array}` `push()` all the items in `array` on the target.
    *   `{$unshift: array}` `unshift()` all the items in `array` on the target.
    *   `{$splice: array of arrays}` for each item in `arrays` call `splice()` on the target with the parameters provided by the item. Note: The items in the array are applied sequentially, so the order matters. The indices of the target may change during the operation.* * `{$set: any}` replace the target entirely.
    *   `{$toggle: array of strings}` toggles a list of boolean fields from the target object.
    *   `{$unset: array of strings}` remove the list of keys in `array` from the target object.
    *   `{$merge: object}` merge the keys of `object` with the target.
    *   `{$apply: function}` passes in the current value to the function and updates it with the new returned value.
    *   `{$add: array of objects}` add a value to a `Map` or `Set`. When adding to a `Set` you pass in an array of objects to add, when adding to a Map, you pass in `[key, value]` arrays like so: `update(myMap, {$add: [['foo', 'bar'], ['baz', 'boo']]})`
    *   `{$remove: array of strings}` remove the list of keys in array from a `Map` or `Set`.

### Event Types

#### CallEvent 
Sends a event of type `call` to the state machine and returns a pending Promise.
    *   Call `call(context, extra)` to emit.
    *   Event handlers can reply with `reply()` action which resolves the pending Promise returned by `call()`.
    *   Internally, call generates a `from` id to identify the caller.
    *   The event route for call is: `call/<from>#<context>#<state>`.

#### CastEvent
Sends a event of type `cast` to the state machine and returns without waiting for a result.
    *   Call `cast(context, extra)` to emit.
    *   The event route for cast is: `cast#<context>#<state>`.

#### EnterEvent
Sends a `enter` event to the state machine.
    *   Internally generated by the state machine on a state transition. If the state machine is transitioning to the same state, `enter` is emitted if the previous event handler returns `repeatState` (and not for either of `keepState`, or `nextState(same state)`).

#### EventTimeoutEvent
Sends a `eventTimeout` event to the state machine.
    *   Internally generated by the state machine when the eventTimeout timer fires.
    *   The eventTimeout timer is started by invoking `eventTimeout(timeout)` in a event handler.
    *   The event route for `eventTimeout` is: `eventTimeout#<context>#<state>`.
    *   Can be cancelled by calling `eventTimeout()` without a timeout argument from an event handler.

#### GenericTimeoutEvent
Sends a `genericTimeout` event to the state machine.
    *   Internally generated by the state machine when the (optionally named) genericTimeout timer fires.
    *   A genericTimeout timer is started by invoking `genericTimeout(timeout [, name])` in a event handler.
    *   The event route for `genericTimeout` is: `genericTimeout#<context>#<state>`.
    *   Can be cancelled by calling `genericTimeout([name])` without a timeout argument from an event handler.

#### StateTimeoutEvent
Sends a `stateTimeout` event to the state machine.
    *   Internally generated by the state machine when the stateTimeout timer fires.
    *   The stateTimeout timer is started by invoking `stateTimeout(timeout)` in a event handler.
    *   The event route for `stateTimeout` is: `stateTimeout#<context>#<state>`.
    *   Can be cancelled by calling `stateTimeout()` without arguments from an event handler.

#### InternalEvent
Sends a `internal` event to the state machine. This is a deliberately named event to let the state machine know that the event is internal.
    *   Internally generated by invoking `internal(context, extra)` from a event handler.
    *   The event route for `internal` is: `internal#<context>#<state>`.

### Processing Events

The state machine looks for the first event handler whose key matches the `incoming event x current state`, or, a catch-all handler.

The matched handler is invoked with the incoming event, route matching arguments, the current state machine state and data.

The result of the handler invocation can include a state transition directive and transition actions, which are immediately executed, potentially changing the state machine’s state, mutating the internal data as well as the event queue.
